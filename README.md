# POS-Tagging-Viterbi
HMMs and modified Viterbi algorithm for Parts of Speech tagging  
  
## Part-of-Speech tagging using modified Viterbi  
We aim to improve POS tagging of unknown words by modifying Viterbi Algorithm.

## Data    
Weâ€™ll use the Treebank dataset of NLTK with the 'universal' tagset. The Universal tagset of NLTK comprises only 12 coarse tag classes as follows: Verb, Noun, Pronouns, Adjectives, Adverbs, Adpositions, Conjunctions, Determiners, Cardinal Numbers, Particles, Other/ Foreign words, Punctuations.
